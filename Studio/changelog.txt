19/02/04 Added world support into the preview control.

09/12/03 Updated texture dictionary tool, dosn't report blending mode correctly, also have been advised 
         by devrels that darkmaps for ps2 should be set as FILTERLINEAR.

03/12/03 Extended 3DUIExtension objects to allow loading of RWG stream files (bsp,dff,rws).

18/11/03 Added stream viewer & editor control into workspace. Allows users to tweak the contents of
         plugin data within the stream (provided a suitable DLL has been written to provide an activeX
         control), with the changes being sent to any connected consoles. Changes are stored in the
         xml file for the asset (the original asset file (bsp, dff, rws) is not changed). Build rules 
         have been updated so that, when connecting to a console, assets are sent with the changes
         embedded.

         Any objects within the stream must have the 'RWS Identifier' user data present before
         the stream editor can change the plugin data - this in an option on the exporters.

17/11/03 Added a new stream function - strfunc_UpdateAsset. This updates a resource and typically calls
	 CResourceHandler::UpdateResource. It can be used by appending the resource's ID and a block of
	 data to be used on the console. This data can be anything that is required to update the relevant
	 resource.

11/11/03 Updates / optimizations to the 3DUIExtension object. Objects are now created in an 'unlocked' state,
         and are not rendered until they are locked. Whilst unlocked, the geometry can be changed (add polygons,
         spheres, etc...). When locked, geometry can not be changed.  Also added 'instancing' mechanism, to
         allow several 3DUIExtension object to share geometry (but different transform / properties).

06/11/03 Changing the texture and font dictionary build rules to use the platform flags string instead of
         the platform string. 'playstation' now becomes 'ps2'.

03/10/03 BugFix, Test fire events didn't work if the RWS_MESSAGE macro followed an RWS_SEPERATOR macro.

26/09/03 Added user control of lighting in 3D Views - can control brightness, and whether lights/atomics
         are lit

25/09/03 BuildLog, BuildWarning, BuildError automatically add the name of the build rule to the start
	 of the message by the ren foi.e. [Rule Name]custom message here

25/09/03 BugFix, it is now possible to override a build rule in a game database. i.e. by creating a build
	 rule called say "Entity" in the game database build rules folder this one will be used in
	 preference to the default one in the RenderWare studio build rules folder. A warning is displayed
	 "[Rule Name] Rule has been overridden." for each rule.

23/09/03 Build rules may now use environment variables when specifying vbs scripts for inclusion.
         For example, it is now possible to specify...
            <script language="VBScript" src="%RENDERWARESTUDIO%\Workspace\Build Rules\BuildTools.vbs"/>

29/09/03 Fixed bug where image loaders for TIFF and RAS files were not registered for the preview control. Bug #6429

07/08/03 Maestro Exporter, command line version which uses null libs for PS2, Xbox and GCN.

	 Just pass in .anm files to command line to export required data.
         Need to have fonts in 'font' folder and textures in 'textures' folder.
         
         Old Maestro Exporter (visual version) has now been removed.

05/08/03 Added a new method to set the offset for new spline nodes from script.
	 The value used to be passed with RWSSpline::NewNodes when the new nodes mode was switched.
	 The value is now only passed via RWSSplineCtrl::SetNodesOffset when the create new nodes mode
	 is switched on.

04/08/03 'DirectX8' platform string automatically changed to 'DirectX' when loading a project
         whose version < 1.20. This is due to the default DirectX platform name changing from
         'DirectX8' to 'DirectX'.

30/07/03 RenderWare Spline support.
	 Created a new ActiveX control (RWSSpline) to manage RenderWare Splines.
	 RWSSpline uses the Graph Module to display the spline data associated with a spline asset.
	 The spline data contained in the asset may be modified in RenderWare Studio.
	 Spline nodes may be moved using the standard pick mechanism in the Orthoviews.
	 Once nodes are selected they can be deleted from the spline and new nodes may be inserted.
	 When the create new nodes mode is turned on from the spline toolbar, new nodes can be created for the
	 spline by picking a point in the Orthoviews.
	 A new spline asset may be created from the asset lister and will be managed by Alienbrain if the project is.
	 A new toolbar has been created and added to the RenderWareStudio.ren file for the operations related to
	 the spline control.
	 Each RenderWare Spline asset (type = rwID_SPLINE) now uses spline.ico for the image in the Asset Lister.

23/07/03 Updated RWS Asset to change font IDs from rwID_2DPLUGIN to rwID_2DFONT.

22/07/03 Added new 'RWS3DSceneControl' (for use with RWS3DUIExtensions) - has interface to enable/disable
         updating of 3D views. Also move object selection interface from IRWS3DEventInfoObject into new
         SceneControl object

11/07/03 Added pick & drag mode, new icon, menu item and 'quick key' (4 key). Allows objects to be dragged around
         the scene and automatically aligns their origins to the result of a ray-test into the scene. Needs
         additional work to allow alignment to be changed, etc.

07/07/03 Changed Animation preview control so that you can control the animation using a slider at the bottom of the window. You also have the option to render the clump's skeleton if one is available.

30/06/03 Added new RWSPersist API function to manage non-database items within the project's changelist. See help for
            RWSPersistFileCheckOut.
         Also added RWSPersistFileImportToVersionControl to add a file directly to version control without making an entry
         to the project's changelist
         Also added RWSPersistPathIsManaged to determine whether a file or folder is managed by version control.
         RWSPersistProjectGetLatest now takes as, an optional argument, the resource root. If this path is managed then 
         the latest version of the files will be obtained from version control.

18/06/03 Made changes to the Animation preview control so that it uses the same Orbit, Pan and Zoom controls as the Ortho views.
	 Firstly this means listening to the menu and toolbars to change the mode, and secondly this involves using the max style navigation.

	 The current max controls in the animation preview window work as follows:
	 RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON             - Pan mode.
	 RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON + ALT KEY   - Orbit mode.
	 RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON + CTRL KEY  - Zoom mode.

11/06/03 The attribute sections for RWSReal and RWSDouble data are now written as a hex encoded representation 
         of the IEEE floating point bits. Each value is followed by a comment within which is the human readable
         form. Data written using versions prior to 1.2 will be read in normally but any subsequent saves will use
         the new, encoded, format. The encoding removes any rounding errors that may be introduced by the load/save
         process.

10/06/03 Added 'Aim at in view' to context menu for assets, etc in the game database window. Also fixed update
         issue with selection menu and selection toolbar (bugzilla 5118).

06/06/03 Added Shift-F3 (menu as Aim At) to locate the selected entity in the view WITHOUT moving the camera's
         position.

06/06/03 The attribute data sections in the project XML have been reformatted to better support UNICODE characters.
         Previous attribute data has been stored within CDATA sections, i.e.
             <Data type="RWSChar" num="9"><![CDATA[TELEPORT]]></Data>
         The new format removes the CDATA section and encodes non-printing or UNICODE characters beyond 255 as
         character references, i.e.
             <Data type="RWSChar" num="9">abcd§&#256;&gt;12</Data>
         The previously CDATA formatted data will be parsed correctly by the new version of RWStudio.

30/05/03 The GUID for an entity or asset is now sent to the console as an array of four integer numbers,
         instead of as a string. This gives a number of advantages:

         - The GUID does not need to be converted to a number from a string on the console anymore.
         - Finding a particular asset or entity on the console is more efficient, as it avoids
            having to convert a string into a number.
         - The GUID of an entity in the workspace is now also the GUID used on the console, making
            identifying a particular asset or entity easier.

         BuildTools.vbs has been modified to write the GUID for an entity or asset as an integer value 
         instead of as a string.

         BuildTools.vbs has also been modified to write the asset name, type, file and dependency path
         as strings padded out to a multiple of 4bytes in size. This avoids some data alignment issues
         with the integer GUID on the PS2.

22/05/03 Modified the orbiting system so that it can operate in three 'types of orbit'. Also modified the operation of the
         alternative orbit point selection ('O' key) and the visuals of the orbit mode.

	 New 'types' are: ORBIT_ONLY = orbits either the world origin, selected object origin or alternative origin;
         ORBIT_OBJECT = orbits selected object or alternative orbit point, but if neither selection or alternative
         set, then it rotates around the camera's view (camera arc rotate); CAMERA_ARC = always rotates about the
         camera's view, except when an alternative orbit point is set. The 3 modes are entered via 3 new icons on the
         tool bar or three new items in the selection menu.

         If 'quick orbit' (via middle mouse button + alt) then the alternative orbit point is ALWAYS ignored in all
         three of these orbit types.

         The 'O' key can still be used to set an alternative orbit point (in the same way, hold and left-click), however,
         it can now be toggled on and off by pressing and releaseing the 'O' key without performing a left-click. The
         alternative orbit is still disabled when selections are made, etc, but you can flick back to the last specified
         alternative orbit by press/release the 'O' key to toggle it.

         Changes to the visuals for the orbit mode are to allow the user to see what they are orbiting around, even if the
         orbit point itself is off screen. The change does NOT show where the orbit point is, but does show which class of
         orbit point is in use. So...

            Normal circle only = orbiting around the camera or camera arc rotate mode.
            Inner circle shown = orbiting around an alternative orbit point, ie one selected using 'O' key + left-click.
            Inner square shown = orbiting around the origin of a selected object.
            Inner cross shown  = orbiting around the world origin (0,0,0).        

22/05/03 Modified the instance edit module to remove bug 5000 - CTRL-clicking a group of entities and then
         CTRL-clicking the last one, unselects them all instead of just the last one. Code now also sends
         out a selection message to indicate which item in a list has become selected when a part-deselection
         occurs. This is sent in addition (immediately after) the deselection pick message, IF there the
         newly modified selection list is not empty.

21/05/03 Added entity reset command to the context menu of entities, entity collections and levels in the
         the game database. The reset command is meant to reset the selected entity / entities in the 
         selected object back to their initial states. 

         A new stream command, strfunc_ResetEntity, has been created to communicate the reset request to 
         the game framework. The full attribute packet for the entity is sent along with the command,
         which the game framework can use to reset the entity. 

         The default implementation of strfunc_ResetEntity in the game framework simply destroys the entity
         and then recreates it. (This can be changed by customising the handler for the strfunc_ResetEntity           command.)

19/05/03 Added function profiling module which enables profiling of functions within the game framework. To eneable the profiler you need to have RWS_FUNCTIONPROFILE defined in gfcore.dsp and game_framework.dsp.

14/05/03 Added selection locking (spacebar while not dragging) and fixed issues with right-button reset on dragging of
         objects in pick&translate, pick&rotate and pick&scale modes.

13/05/03 Added Memory profiling control to the workspace. The user interface is similar to the metrics control where data
         for a specific connection is viewed using the right click context menu.

13/05/03 Expected behavior improvements to Metrics control, several menu options added, Delete All, Reset and Stop. User
         can select more than one connection to apply the context menu action to. The graph window re-opens using the
         last size and viewing multiple windows offsets them.

12/05/03 Modified the default flight keys (w->S, S->X, R->F and F->V) so that Q, W, E & R can be used for Max-style pick
         only, pick & translate, pick & rotate and pick & scale selection. Also added pick only mode. Added toolbar icon
         and menu option for 'lock selection' but no underlying code, yet.

         NOTE: the .settings file must be deleted and the default one inserted to cause the new features to work correctly.


12/05/03 Added RADIO_BUTTON attribute editor, uses a similar declaration to the LIST control to display (n) items each
         with a button to select it. Selecting one deselects all of the others. Below is an example of the source code
         decoration required to use it.

         RWS_ATTRIBUTE( CMD_RadioRwUInt32, "RADIO RwUInt32","Right Click - View Source for details",RADIO_BUTTON, RwUInt32, LIST("red|green|blue|@cyan|purple"))

29/04/03 (ref: change list 16054) Modified the .ren file so that the middle-mouse-button can be used to 'quick enter'
         the pan, orbit (+ALT) and zoom (+ALT & CTRL) modes (there is also a fast-pan mode on middle-mouse-button +
         CTRL only). The mode remains until the mouse button is release, at which point it reverts to the previously
         selected mode. While the button is held, clicking the right-mouse button will reset the camera to where it
         was when the mode was entered / a modifier key (ALT & CTRL) was pressed / released. Additionally, some tidying
         of the code occurred...

         *) The selected view is now modified when the mouse moves into the window instead of when the window is clicked.
            This has the side-effect of fixing mouse wheel zoom in isometric views.

         *) CInstanceEdit::OnMouseButtonDown & ...Up used to globally capture and release the mouse movement, the code
            to do this has now been removed - it has had no visible effect and it's reason for inclusion was unknown.

         *) CMaxNavigation has had the m_alt_nav_mode1 & 2 + m_alt_mode1 & 2 variables removed. The InqAltNavigationMode
            and InqAltNavigationKey function have been modified to output a warning message (function deprecated).

         *) Also the 'CorrectedNavMode' function and associated variables, etc have been removed - unused functionality.
         
14/04/03 Workspace now displays the name of the user who has a file checked out from alienbrain.
         This has required changes to the RWSPersistIDGetStatus and RWSPersistFileGetStatus functions to
         retrieve this extended information in a structure.

24/03/03 Added 'wireframe display' override to the 3D UI extension objects

20/03/03 Checkin code will now submit all files within the Assets, Entities, Games, Levels and Collections folders
         of the project, regardless of whether there are entries in the changelog. This is to provide improved 
         checkin times.

24/02/03 Fixed the invincible tooltips (Bug 4156)

24/02/03 Fixed TargetLink problem - sending wrong attribute in rare cases.
	 (inheritance hierarchies containing same attribute name in 2 or more classes)

24/02/03 Event visualizer now pans more naturally.

21/02/03 Updates to source parser to remove error reports

20/02/03 Event Visualizer now zooms out further, reducing the font size to suit.

17/02/03 The visibility status of entities is now persisted.

14/03/03 Added event logging to the RenderWare import to help track down bad assets - enabled by registry setting :
           in HKCU\Software\CSL\RenderWare Studio, add a DWORD value called 'ImportLogEnable', and
           set the value to 1 to enable, 0 to disable
           Logging is fixed to 'c:\RWStudio_Import_Log.txt'

14/02/03 The RWSPrst (XML parser) API now issues a callback (set using RWSPersistErrorSetCallback) for all 
         errors encountered. This provides improved error reporting in Workspace.

11/02/03 When getting latest or undoing checkouts with the alienbrain integration the system now honors the 
         modtime settings specified in the alienbrain client. Previously the integration enforced the "DEFAULT"
         modtime setting when files were obtained from the server.

10/01/03 Removed RWSComms->RWSCAppendGenerateTextureDictionary() and CommsImpl->StreamGenerateTextureDictionary()
	 since strfunc_WriteTextureDictionary is no longer used.

24/01/03 The alienbrain integration now uses a combination of file size and CRC value to determine if the
         user has the latest version of a file. The integration with alienbrain now supports the use of
         either DEFAULT, CHECK-iN and CURRENT alienbrain settings for time stamping client files.

15/01/03 Workspace now uses the new type: Template Collections.

08/01/03 Workspace now supports .ras and .tif (as well as .bmp and .tga)

06/01/03 RWSAttributeControl.dll has now been renamed to RWSAttributeEditor.dll. 
         This does not affect any of the contained components.

15/11/02 Added a database validation/repair tool.

13/11/02 Improved GDI resource usage in Game Database, Behavior Lister and Asset Lister.

12/11/02 Added the GUIDEnforcer app. This checks that all IDs are GUID, optionally replacing ALL
         IDs with new GUIDs.

12/11/02 Added import functionality - now able to import levels and templates.

12/11/02 Fixed a bug where launching workspace by double clicking a .rwstudio file in explorer was
	 sometimes causing workspace to deadlock.

12/11/02 Added new display modes for 3D views : solid/wireframe + textured/untextured

08/11/02 Texture dictionaries creation has been enhanced, such that texture dictionaries should now contain
	 the same textures as those created on the console. MipKl values should now be preserved and
	 textures used by MatFX are now included.

07/11/02 To aid in dragging assets or templates multiple times into the orthoviews, a 'stamp' feature
	 has been added. Simply press the space bar while dragging a new item into the view and a copy
	 of the new object will be placed at the current mouse coordinate.

06/11/02 Added support for objects named using unicode characters.

06/11/02 It is now possible to customise the available platforms by changing the RwStudio.settings file.

31/10/02 Added FPSSkyDome behaviour, used to render a world as a sky dome.

29/10/02 Made object edit axis/handles have three separate modes - translate, rotate and scale -
         with additional toolbar buttons + F10 to cycle between the modes

29/10/02 Added an enhancement which speeds up rendering of objects referenced multiple times in the hierarchy.

29/10/02 Changed the load such that only assets that are part of the current level are loaded
	 into memory. The remaining assets are loaded on demand.

23/10/02 Fixing memory leaks in Event Visualizer and changing static arrays to dynamic vectors
	 to allow arbitrary sized graphs.  This will enable the use of large databases with many
	 messages if desired.

23/10/02 Version incremented to 1.1 Beta

23/10/02 Added an extra script into the ren file, AppSettings, to store settings. Added the option to set the time before a tooltip appears in the game view and how long it stays displayed.

         get latest, connect to alienbrain server and import project to alienbrain.

16/08/02 Texture dictionaries for DirectX and OpenGL now save out in a platform independent format. A new asset type 	         has also been added called rwID_PITEXDICTIONARY

15/08/02 Added comms launch commands and platforms to settings file (rather than in registry).
	 Added default network ports to platforms to make them configurable.
	 Changed default network port for D3D to 5607 to stop OpenGL and D3D connections being mixed up.

14/08/02 Added the ability to set an active level and an active entity collection. This becomes the new parent for all newly created entities.

14/08/02 Asset types now also shows rwID_HANIMANIMATION, rwID_2DPLUGIN, and rwID_2DMAESTRO by default.

            new 'plane-drag' mode for edit axes, allow dragging in x-y, y-z or z-x plane
              (switch to mode with mouse double-click over axes)

06/08/02 Renamed RWS Manager API RWSAsset structure's "Location" field to "Dependencies".

31/07/02 Added support for hex values in color picker.

29/07/02 Updated property pages to handle multiple items (e.g. editing all assets to change the dependency path).

29/07/02 Removed KeyDown check in Event Viz, keys are now handled through the script.

26/07/02 Added call to reload asset when message received, this signals a change and triggers
	 the update on the console.

24/07/02 Added 'Templates' feature to Workspace. A template of an entity can be created by an entities context menu. The new template can then be dragged into orthoviews to create identical copies of the original entity.

19/07/02 Added 'Reload' to an assets context menu. The asset will be reloaded from disk and resent to the console.

18/07/02 Made repeated load/new/reload robust.  Consequence of this is that all controls now attach/detach synchronously to the database (rather than posting messages to their window).  RWS Wizard updated to reflect this change.

11/07/02 Added 'Collections' to Manager API. A collection can be created with the RWSCollectionCreate API function and can be used to group together objects of the same type. User interface updated to understand collections of assets and entities.

         and becoming unpickable.

15/03/02 Should now be able to CTRL+Left click on a selected object to deselect it, not just on the actual axes.

14/03/02 Fixed corruption in attribute editor due to unexpected tabs in source code.

14/03/02 File|Save now only saves the XML files that have changed or are new, whilst File|SaveAs will attempt to save
         the whole XML database. File|Save saves to the last loaded file name.

11/03/02 New output window to provide diagnostic and progress messages.

11/03/02 Changed description when there is no database for the event visualisation module, it now says
	 - 'Event Visualization No Game Definition'.

11/03/02 Added first implementation of Event Visualisation module. This includes the source and a bin folder for
	 the GraphViz application which is used to obtain the layout for the event graph. Controls are as follows:
	 Left mouse: drag to move graph, Mouse wheel: zoom in/ out, Right mouse: Refresh graph,
	 W, A, S, D: Move graph, +, -: Zoom in/ out, Z: Refresh graph.
	 You can use Menu->Edit->Refresh Event View to rebuild the graph too.

08/03/02 Updates to Object dragging - now haves switch to change between dragging in local or world coordinates.
         Global snapping working, + switch to turn off/on the auto-resizing of the axes as the camera

         object is half embedded in the floor or a wall.

06/03/02 Added initial integration with alienbrain by using permission callbacks in API.
         Setting of dirty flags in API for objects that are modified. Save now only saves dirty objects, whereas SaveAs will

28/02/02 Object lister now does not back-face cull the objects in it.

27/02/02 New attribute editor.  Allows customers to write their own plug-in controls (no documentation or wizard yet).

27/02/02 Comms overhaul - stream-based comms provides ability for attribute editor to create default attributes on
         the fly.  Ability to write/read file-based comms streams (API only).
         Ability for a target to send a stream of any size to the RWS API.

26/02/02 Altered display of grid in ortho-views to not fade out + zoom in/out nicely
         (grid in perspective remains the same). Also, linked the FOV's of the ortho-views
         together, on an option.

	 set to rwFILTERNEARESTMIPLINEAR, all other platforms are rwFILTERLINEARMIPLINEAR.
	 Which are the defaults renderware would normally choose.

12/02/02 Updated Renderware/Realimation import filter so that light mapped BSP's are
	 imported correctly.

11/02/02 The basics of RenderWare Studio Manager API (also commonly known as "The Dog" or "The Server"). Its purpose
	includes maintaining a list of created objects, a hierarchy of parent/child object relations and
	providing notification events of changes to the data. The API has been implemented as an external process to
	the Workspace, as this currently allows exporters to connect to the API and populate the scene. If this
	process is killed, then Workspaces view of the game data is removed and its behavior becomes undefined.
	
	With the recent changes to support multiple game databases, there are now two different executables that are
	created with calls to the API. When RWSInitialize is called, an instance of RWSNamespace.exe is spawned (or
	connected to if one already exists). This provides the API with a way to create, delete and enumerate named
	instances of game databases. RWSGameDB.exe represents a game database, and is created every time a call to
	RWSDatabaseCreate succeeds. Before the database can be used, it must be attached to with a call to
	RWSDatabaseAttach.

8/02/02 Improved XML load times.

11/02/02 The object lister has been optimised to speed up the display of the data and reduce graphics memory overhead.
         "Small Icon", "Large Icon" and "List" viewing modes have been added to make large data sets easier to view.

02/02/02 The interface to the RWS Manager API has been modified for all RWSEvent<Description> calls. The new changes
	allow multiple callbacks in a single thread. These changes will not affect any code that doesn't use events.

02/02/02 The RWS Manager API has been altered to allow multiple instances of the game database to be created.
	Databases can now be created, enumerated and attached to. The first running database can be attached to by,

		RWSDatabaseID DatabaseID = RWSDatabaseGetFirst ();
		if (DatabaseID)
			RWSDatabaseAttach (DatabaseID);
		ASSERT (RWSENoError == RWSErrorGetLast ());

	The RWSServer.exe process has been renamed to 
	See the API documentation for further details.

02/02/02 The interfaces for the RWS Manager API have been renamed to follow the "RWS<Object><Description>" naming
	convention. Backwards compatibility macro's have been added to ease the change over. These will be deleted
	before the next release.
