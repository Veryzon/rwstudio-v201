<h1>About this tool</h1>
<p>The PurgeDeleted tool lists the XML files in a RenderWare Studio game database that contain a <code>&lt;Deleted/&gt;</code> element, indicating that the corresponding object has been deleted.</p>
<p>We recommend that you run this tool periodically to clean up these files.</p>
<p><strong>If you are using NXN alienbrain:</strong> This tool only deletes files on your PC. After running this tool, remember to remove the copies of the files on the server.</p>
<p>You can run this tool via either:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PurgeDeleted.wsf</code> (a Windows script file)
<p>or</p>
</li>
<li><code>PurgeDeleted.hta</code> (an HTML application)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Windows script command-line options</h2>
<p>The Windows script file offers several command-line options. To see these options, open a command prompt window, change to the directory containing the script, and then enter:</p>
<pre>
PurgeDeleted.wsf /?
</pre>
<p>For example, if you run the Windows script file with the <code>/project:<var>myproject</var>.rwstudio</code> option, then the tool immediately scans for deleted objects in that game database, rather than prompting you to select a project. This is especially useful if you typically work on the same project all of the time. You might even want to create a shortcut that invokes this tool for your project. Here is the Target property from such a shortcut (shown here split over several lines, for clarity):</p>
<pre class="code">
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\WSCRIPT.EXE
"C:\RW\Studio\Programs\Tools\PurgeDeleted\PurgeDeleted.wsf"
/project:"C:\Studio Projects\ProjectX.rwstudio"
</pre>
<h2>Running in batch mode</h2>
<p>To run this tool without displaying a window, append a <code>//B</code> switch to the Windows script file command line.</p>
