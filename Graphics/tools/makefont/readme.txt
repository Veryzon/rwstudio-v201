--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

This Microsoft Windows console program can be used to create METRIC1 BMP
fonts from True Type fonts, for use with the Rt2d toolkit.  The program
creates the BMP file and the MET file for the font.

The typeface name of the font is passed on the command line as well as any
options for creating the BMP, the resulting BMP and MET files are created
with the name of the font and it's point size e.g. "courier10.bmp" and
"courier10.met"

This program can only create BMP fonts for the fonts that are on your
system, if a font is not available a substitute font will be selected.

For example to create the BMP and MET file for a Times New Roman font with
a point size of 10, on the command line do:

     makefont -p10 "times new roman"
