          RenderWare Graphics Viewer Program (win): 2dviewer
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE

The 2dviewer allows various 2d files to be loaded and displayed back.
Supported formats are 2D .anm (Maestro and simple animations) and .dff
(2d objects, eg shapes, text strings, scenes) files.

If an animation is loaded a correspondingly named scene file must be in
the same directory.

Files to be viewed are specified as command line arguments, or may be
dragged to the viewer at runtime.

The 2dViewer is mentioned in the Maestro User Guide chapter in 
docs\userguide\userguidevol3.pdf and 2dconverter.pdf in the docs\tools. 
Both these documents can be found within the RenderWare Graphics directory.

2dviewer can have button lookup functionality enabled by setting the
WITH_BUTTON_DISPLAY #define in main.c. This allows assignment of named
buttons within the Flash animation to key pushes.
