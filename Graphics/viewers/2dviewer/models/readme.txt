NOTES FOR PLAYING EXAMPLE .ANMs
===============================

Make sure that the 2dviewer is run from the viewers\2dviewer, and not the data
directory. 2dviewer expects to find a 'font' directory under the directory
from which it is run.

Do this by either (a) running it from Windows Explorer or (b) changing directory
to viewers\2dviewer, then running the executable.

The sample .anm files
   static05.anm
   static07.anm
   mainmenu.anm
use fonts.
